# print[] Hello there 👋

## About me 📓
I'm Minh, a high-school student, creator of the FreakC Programming Language, Javascript fan, fluent in Javascript and FreakC/Batch, a mediocre Pascal and C++ competitive programmer.

I'm currently studying blockchains and stuffs like that, and have got pretty interested in Near, a super fast, low-cost dApp platform. 

I do game dev in my free time with the bois btw.

## Skills 💪
* Front-end web development.
* Game development.
* Competitive programming.
* Knows stuffs about language design I guess 😕.
* I have known more than 30 programming languages, but I mostly use Javascript, Pascal, C++, GDScript, FreakC, Batch.

## Nice events 📆
* 2020: Placed 5th, won the 🥈 in HongKong International Computational Olympiad.
* 2020: Created FreakC, which is my first big project considering how simple (and crappy-code-infested) it is.
