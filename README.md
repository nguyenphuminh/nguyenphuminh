# print[] Hello there 👋

<br/>

## About me 📓
I'm Minh, a high-school student, founder of FreakC Foundation, creator of the FreakC Programming Language, Javascript fan, fluent in Javascript and FreakC/Batch, a mediocre Pascal and C++ competitive programmer.

I'm currently studying blockchains and stuffs like that, and have got pretty interested in Near - a super fast, low-cost dApp platform. 

I do game dev in my free time with the bois btw.

I'm Interested in programming languages too. There was a time that I'm obsessed with languages (especially esolangs or unique ones). Now I still like them, but not seriously addicted to them anymore lol.

## Skills 💪
* Front-end web development.
* Game development.
* Competitive programming.
* Knows stuffs about language design I guess 😕.
* I know a good amount of programming languages, but I mostly use Javascript, Pascal, C++, GDScript, FreakC, Batch.

## Nice events 📆
* 2020: Placed 5th, won the 🥈 in HongKong International Computational Olympiad.
* 2020: Created FreakC, which is my first big project considering how simple (and crappy-code-infested) it is.

## My *dumb* repos 😕
* [discord.fclang](https://github.com/FreakC-Foundation/discord.fclang) - A crappy discord api wrapper for FreakC.
* [JellyAV](https://github.com/nguyenphuminh/JellyAV) - A probably-not-gonna-work antivirus program written just for fun in Batch.

## Hire me?
I'm not looking for a job (school is so busy 😢), but if you have a nice, j4f project with friends, I can join/help 😺.
